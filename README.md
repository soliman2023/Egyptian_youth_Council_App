# Egyptian youth Council App

Created the Back-End for Egyptian Youth Council Mobile Application.

## Project Overview:
The Egyptian Youth Council (EYC) is the bigest organization that is dedicated to representing the interests and concerns of young people in Egypt. While specific details may vary over time, typically, youth councils like this aim to provide a platform for young individuals to voice their opinions, engage in civic activities, and contribute to community development. To achieve this goal, the council requires a robust mobile application that facilitates seamless interaction between members, offers resources, and showcases opportunities for involvement.

## Objective:
Develop a scalable and secure backend system along with an efficient database structure to support the functionality of the Egyptian Youth Council mobile application. The backend should handle user authentication, data storage, real-time communication, and integration with third-party services.
